# Real-World Examples

This directory contains community-contributed conversion examples with empirical validation data.

## Contributing Examples

We welcome real-world examples that demonstrate JIT architecture conversion in practice. Valuable contributions include:

- Measured token reduction percentages
- Before/after comparison data
- Lessons learned and observations
- Edge cases encountered

## Submission Guidelines

1. Anonymize any proprietary content
2. Use the evaluation framework for measurements
3. Include test cases and results
4. Document any limitations or caveats

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed submission guidelines.

## Example Template

```markdown
# [Domain] Conversion Example

## Overview
- **Domain**: [Industry/Use case]
- **Original size**: X tokens
- **Converted size**: Y tokens (core) + Z avg JIT
- **Measured reduction**: X%

## Context
[Description of the original use case]

## Architecture
[Core prompt and JIT file structure]

## Results
[Measurements using evaluation framework]

## Lessons Learned
[What worked, what didn't, recommendations]
```
